# computer-graphics-transformation

This program performs transformations - Rotation, Translation, Scaling, Shearing and Reflection, on objects.
It works for both 2D and 3D objects.
It also performs concatenation - multiple transformations at once.
After transformation, it draws the original shape based on the coordinates and the new shape based on the transformed coordinates.
